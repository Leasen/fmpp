## What is FMPP?

FMPP is a general-purpose text file preprocessing tool that uses
FreeMarker templates. It is particularly designed for HTML preprocessing,
for the generation of complete (static) home-pages: directory structure
that contains HTML-s, image files, etc.

### Features
* Uses FreeMarker templates
* Can be used to generate completely static websites
* Easily parse JSON files to generate documentation
* Java classes can pull data from any data source (such as a database) and then embed the data into the generated files.
* Supports UN*X-style command-line interface and Ant tasks
* Embed into your Java application to generate files as part of your build
* Generate source code (or any kind of text file)
